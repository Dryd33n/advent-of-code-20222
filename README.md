## Day 1: Calorie Counting 

Task 1: You are part of an expedition with a group of Elves, each of whom is carrying food items with a certain number of Calories. Your task is to find the Elf carrying the most Calories and calculate the total number of Calories they are carrying. In Task 2, you are given an updated task to find the top three Elves carrying the most Calories and calculate the total number of Calories they are carrying.

## Day 2: Rock Paper Scissors

Task 1: Calculate your total score if you follow a strategy guide consisting of two columns, with the first indicating your opponent's play and the second your response. The score for each round is based on the shapes chosen and the outcome (win, lose, or draw).
Task 2: Calculate your total score if you follow the same strategy guide as in Task 1, but now the second column indicates the desired outcome of the round (X for lose, Y for draw, and Z for win). Choose a shape that will result in the indicated outcome. The score for each round is still based on the shapes chosen and the outcome.
